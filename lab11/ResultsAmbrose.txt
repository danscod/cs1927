Notes (what the above indicates):

-All in all entering the data in a random order gives the lowest depth and cost most likely because entering the nodes in a random order balances the tree out more than acesending/descending or prefix order. 

- Acending order gives the highest depth on average as if you insert constantly with a bigger number the tree will never balance, only when the inserting method balances it. The cost then rises as searching the tree requires searching the whole tree (Nearly)

-Prefix order gives different depths but mainly keeps a low cost. This is because prefixed order builds  a balanced tree if inserted normally.
